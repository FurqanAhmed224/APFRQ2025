#### My initial approach during the exam:
- I'm glad i rememberd how to intialize arrayList, the understanding of the prompt wasn't too difficult, might have forogt some increments thoough

- Made sure to increment startIndex and endIndex, and overall was pretty okay
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- ArrayLists was tested during this prompt, loops, and index management
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- ArrayList was revisited
