# APFRQ2025

Solutions written by Furqan Ahmed

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 05-7-25. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included watching helpful youtube videos about the exam and princeton textbook- reviewing the topics - (I should have started earlier in the semester, gotten ahead, and practiced coding on my own.)
- The most challenging aspects of the exam was the timing in the end and even in the MCQ, and breaking down some of the FRQ one by one
- Time management techniques that worked well for me is pacing my self when doing MCQ/FRQ questions - (I Shouldeve done a lot more when the semester started)
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions try to break it down piece by piece and keep repeating it in my head and actually undestand what it's asking for

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: Time Managment
- Topic/Concept 2: Do more coding problems on PickCode by myself and get used to it
- Use AI to give you prompts and code it by yourself

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- CSAWESOME - https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/index.html
- CodeAcademy - https://www.codecademy.com/
- Princeton textbook - (Just for reviewing the units)
- Any person on youtube who explains it well

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Learn new coding languages and code more often whatever it is
- Want to make a starter website with HTML and CSS - (Not finished yet)
- Just code more often
