## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Understand both prompts
- Pretty straightfoward task, nothing crazy, maybe forgetting some key information  other then that it was pretty well written
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- Found a better way to solve it, rather in my original approach, using 2 for statements and I couldeve only put it all in one if statement.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Wants to test your ability on class design, intitializing vatiable, method implementation, and etc
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Learned more about helper methods and their usage in the ap exam
