## Question 2 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- The starting portion of the question 2 was easy to understand, but it started getting harder with the addSignature method, might have made unncessary mistakes
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- add signature method dealt with indexOf mostly and other key concepts
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- In this question: class design was shown here and method design
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- It came back to understanding indexOf mostly and maybe substring too
