## Question 4 Analysis
### Puzzle

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2D Arrays):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- This one for me was definetly the hardest, the wording on this one was at weird first and hard to break dowm, and time was not on my side either
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- It's a 2D array question with random integers, the question isn't hard, definetly if you understood the question it wasn't anything crazy.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Array initilization, tranversing a 2D array, index mangementm and Logic
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Revisted initializing 2D arrays and Random numbers
